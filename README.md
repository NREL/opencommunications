The master branch of this profile is no longer a sub-profile of the <a href="https://github.com/acquia/lightning">Lightning profile</a>.

The master branch is being used to build a simplified Drupal 9 profile for our own purposes, which will not implement the same out-of-the-box functionality currently in the profile, and that does not have the dependency on Lightning. **The code on the master branch is not stable and should not be used**.

The stable Drupal 8 versions of this profile are still available on branches 4.1.3, 4.1.5 and 4.1.9, but will reach end-of-life in November 2021 when <a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/acquia-lightning-eol-2021-acquia-cms-future">Lightning reaches end-of-life</a> at the same time as Drupal 8 reaches end-of-life.
